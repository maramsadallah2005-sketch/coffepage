      <img src="images/coffee.jpg" class="pincoffee" alt="icon"

  
  <p> Coffee’s story begins in Ethiopia,
     where legend says a goat herder named Kaldi noticed his goats becoming energetic after eating red berries from a certain plant. 
     From there, coffee spread to the Arabian Peninsula, where it was first cultivated and brewed in Yemen in the 15th century.
      Coffeehouses soon became centers of social life and learning, and by the 17th century, coffee had traveled to Europe and beyond, eventually growing into the global drink and culture we know today.
